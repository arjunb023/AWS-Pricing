Directory Information:
- index.html (main page)
- main.js (logic for polling data and filtering)

Notes:
- Run index.html
- Data is polled on load and every 10 seconds
- You can choose region, instance, and size to filter from
- Instance and Size are changed depending on region and instance selected, respectively
- Filter changes the graph depending on filter requirements
- Prices do not change very frequently, I usually have to wait anywhere from a minute to 10 minutes to see differences in prices
